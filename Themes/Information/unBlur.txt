Notes:
- (*NEW* v1.6x) Now that the Homepage can be re-ordered. You must make sure that the Media Search is at the top with the speedtest tab directly after it, otherwise they won't work properly.
- Only Slim top bar is currently supported.
- Only elegant notifications are currently supported.
- The root options in the custom css box can all be edited to your liking.
- unBlur will move the chat icon from the top bar to the black bar of your homepage. If you wish to re-enable the chat icon in the top bar add
<code>&#x3C;link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; type=&#x22;text/css&#x22; href=&#x22;ajax.php?a=show-file&#x26;file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leram84/layer.Cake/master/Add-Ons/topbar-chat.css&#x22;&#x3E;</code>
