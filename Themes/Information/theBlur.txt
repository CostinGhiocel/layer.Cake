Instructioins
Step 1: Choose your button html from one of the option below and edit if needed (Make sure to update as there are changes from the beta)
  <a href="https://github.com/leram84/layer.Cake/blob/master/Add-Ons/html/theBlur-buttons.html" target="_blank">Default For Plex Users</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/leram84/layer.Cake/blob/master/Add-Ons/html/theBlur-buttons-chat-tab.html" target="_blank">For Plex Users who want the chat button to go to the chat tab instead of the chat sidebar</a>

Step 2: Upload your top bar logo to Organizr from the "Edit Tabs" screen under the name "blurlogo.png". (This will make your logo show up in a few places throughout your site, most notably the login page) 
Step 3: Select theBlur as your theme, save, refresh and enjoy!
Notes:
- Only Slim top bar is currently supported.
- Only elegant notifications are currently supported.
- The root options in the custom css box can all be edited to your liking, and the four colors at the bottom will adjust the homepage calendar colors.
- theBlur will move the chat icon from the top bar to the black bar of your homepage. If you wish to re-enable the chat icon in the top bar add
<code>&#x3C;link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; type=&#x22;text/css&#x22; href=&#x22;ajax.php?a=show-file&#x26;file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leram84/layer.Cake/master/Add-Ons/topbar-chat.css&#x22;&#x3E;</code>
